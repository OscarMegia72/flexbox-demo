              SCREAM 4 revives all of our favorite 
              slasher movie motifs and still manages to craft 
              a few new surprises as veteran horror director Wes 
              Craven launches another bloody roller coaster ride 
              through the unlucky town of Woodsboro. The site of writer Kevin Williamson’s original SCREAM film, Woodsboro hosts a new group of familiar celebrity faces who openly discuss the clichés of popular horror movies while trying to outrun a killer. The success of the SCREAM franchise lies in the packaging of successful actors, wry dialog and innovative ways to die. This fourth installment of Craven’s three-picture deal proves there is still box office gold to be mined from the comedy / whodunit / horror genre.

            A Florida Connection
          </p>
              <p>
                  SCREAM’s 1996 launch was inspired by a real American serial killer called “The Gainesville Ripper” who targeted five Florida college students during a gory 90′s crime spree.

                  Screenwriter Kevin Williamson is a fan of cult horror movies like Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980) which centered upon a group of hapless teens trying to escape a masked psychopath. Penned in the mid-1990s, the original script succeeded because it satirized the world of horror movies and brought the audience in on the joke.
